# node-simple-informational-site

A very basic site. More like a template than a site, given that it contains no real information or functionality.

But it was good for a little practice early in my learning of node.js. 

I got to play with the http, url, and fs modules, create a server, troubleshoot a few issues, and write test scripts to figure out (a) what various user-side actions send in the request data, (b) what various module methods return, and (c) to identify where bugs were occuring.
